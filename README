Interface Prototpye is a jquery plugin that takes a Hotspot linked PNG and generates an interactive clickable design concept. It is intended to be used for demoing iPad and iPhone applications.

Demo

If you visit this on a desktop, you will be able to select between viewing the iPad and iPhone mockups.

If you visit it on an iPad or iPhone, you will be served the respective mockups, and the concept will autorotate to match your devices orientation.

What It Does

Device Detection

This plugin is bundled with device detection. If you visit this plugin from an iPad, it will look for /library/ipad/ and attempt to serve an iPad specific set of mockups.

If you visit the plugin from an iPhone, it will attempt to serve /library/iphone/

If you visit the plugin from a desktop client, it will serve /library/ipad/, wrap it in an iPad container, and give you a button for rotating the view.


Device Orientation

If you visit the plugin on an iPad or iPhone, it will recognize the device, and automatically rotate the view to match the orientation of the device.
